### 🏙️ Cost of Living Context
- Many commenters earning >$100k express feeling financially stretched in Toronto
- Frequent comparisons to US salaries highlight a perceived wage gap
- StatCan data ($89.6k average, $69.9k median for full-time Toronto workers) suggests this sample skews higher than the general population
